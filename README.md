# üåü The Maze Project üåü

Welcome to **The Maze Project**! This project showcases a maze game with custom maps using SDL2 and raytracing. Dive into the world of mazes and experience the magic of real-time rendering!

### üéÆ The birth of an A-Maze-ing game!

#### Introduction

This is the story of a game, but not any game, this is the culmination of a year of SE learning at ALX, and the starting point of the most entertaining game in the web!

The project began as a small idea: I am a gamer, I love games, what is the best portfolio project that I could make ever? Exactly! a game.

This game was created with what I learned at ALX, C variables, loops, data structures, functions and lots, lots of mathematics.

#### The Project development process

After choosing the project, I started by reading about SDL2, Raycasting, and the mathematic calculations needed to enable raycasting.

I started experimenting with a blank SDL2 window, choosing the title, dimensions, and other settings, I started with a small c file that contains all the the needed functions, compiled, and Tada!!! it works!

Now let's move to the next step, add a map.
I added an array of zeros and ones to the main function, set up values for player position, fov, camera position, and made some calculations, defined the colors of each face of the 3D representation, and after a lot of trials and errors, it did'nt work!

It was in this moment, that I decided to make a pause, watch some Animes, drink a cup of tea, read the documentation, then go back to work, after another session of trials and errors, it was finally alive !!!

The program was running fine, and it was colorful, the dimensions were a bit off but I managed to get them done at the end, the view was worth all that fatigue and stress!

Then I needed to implement movement, I started with camera movement, using mouse and keyboard, and it worked just fine, then I implemented player's movement using WASD keys, it was looking great!

Now it's time for a new challenge, Implementing Textures.
I started by reading the doc of SDL2-Image, choosing textures, then finding a way to apply them instead of solid colors, after a lot of trial and error again, I finished by succeeding, and the results were fabulous!

After this, I applied another texture for the floor, then choose a simple blue color for the sky, The game is looking gorgeous!!

IMAGE HOLDER SCREEN APP WITH TEXTURE

After that, I implemented a minimap that can be switched on or off using M key, it was like doing a little game inside of the main game, but the result was very satisfying!

IMAGE HOLDER MAP

After that I edited the program to accept a text mapfile as an argument, then parse it to have a customized map.

IMAGE HOLDER FILE

After everything has been done, a little problem remained: making all these c files and headers compliant with [Holeberton School Betty Style](https://github.com/alx-tools/Betty) tool. And it was quite the challenge!

Betty style imposed special guidelines when coding using C:
- A file cannot contain more than 5 functions
- All functions and data structures must be documented
- A function cannot exceed 40 lines
- A line cannot exceed 80 characters
- Global variables are forbidden

I started by splitting up my c files, splitting the lines over 80 characters, and creating smaller functions while calling them from the previous bigger functions.
One small problem was remaining, I used global variables to hold the game state, so it was inevitable that I choose another method. A friend of mine proposed Data structures, and it was awesome!

I created data structures to hold key press states, game state, and it was awesome, I was able to manipulate data over the game like before, and clean output of Betty Checker gave me a huge satisfaction!

The game was ready, it was playable, and I met the deadline with more functions than I was even aiming at before, It was a tremendous success!

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

(Instructions for Ubuntu and debian based distros)
To get started, you need to install the necessary prerequisites. Simply run the following script:

```bash
sudo ./install_SDL2.sh
```

##¬†üèóÔ∏è Compilation

(Instructions for Ubuntu and debian based distros)
Once the prerequisites are installed, compile the project by running:

```bash
./compil.sh
```

## üöÄ Usage

Execute the program using a map file (a 24 by 24 file of zeros and ones that represent a maze):

```bash
./myapp mapfile
```

Replace mapfile with the path to your maze file.

## üó∫Ô∏è Map File Format

The map file should be a 24x24 grid of zeros and ones, where:

    0 represents an open path
    1 represents a wall

Example map file:

```Map
111111111111111111111111
100000000000000000000001
101111111111111111111101
